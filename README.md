<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

   I was practicing on js and I did lots of projects until I decided to work on a big one, the first idea that came to my mind is to build a 
   quran player, I did my research and I found bunch of nice apis but I didn't find any website design to work with.
   here I took the decision to do a light clone to the [quran.com](https://quran.com/) website so I can put all my focus on coding and 
   implementing this awesome website's ideas with my touch  and don't have to worry about the design, 
   and here it is the result of the hard work, I'm proud of the app, I tried my best, I learned lots things.

<!-- What I have learned -->
## What I have learned 
I heard before about learning from doing and how much it is good than taking bunch of tutorials, in this project I realized that is absolutely true.

#### Js modules
While I'm working on the project my js code became big and unorganized, I researched for a solution and I found modules, I learned them, I implemented them.
#### Css bem methodology 
My css classes naming was bad, I researched for a solution and I found bem methodology, I learned it, I implemented it.
#### Accessibility
I learned how to do Accessible Cross-Browser Radio and checkbox inputs.
#### Audio player
I learned how to do a audio player.
#### NPM
I got familiar with npm by using ESLint library with ESLint extension to catch errors .
